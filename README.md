# Object-detection-and-localization-based-on-CNN
A phone localization project which based on convolutional neural networks with a regression head


1) train_phone_finder.py takes a single command line argument which is a path to a folder with labeled images and labels.txt that has been attached to this description. This script may generate any artifacts you want in the current folder. Here is what a terminal command will look like:
> python train_phone_finder.py ~/find_phone

2) find_phone.py takes a single command line argument which is a path to the jpeg image to be tested. This script may use data in the local folder previously generated by train_phone_finder.py . This script has to print the normalized coordinates of the phone detected on this test image in the format shown below. Here is what a terminal command will look like (notice space separated float numbers on a single line):
> python find_phone.py ~/find_phone_test_images/51.jpg
